##  Steps Performed

### 1. Choose and Sign Up
- Selected **ProtonVPN Free Tier** from [https://protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com).  
- Created a free account and verified via email.

### 2. Download and Install
- Downloaded the ProtonVPN client for Windows.  
- Installed using default setup options and logged in with the account credentials.

### 3. Connect to VPN Server
- Opened ProtonVPN app.  
- Selected the nearest or any available **VPN server** (e.g., India, Singapore, Netherlands).  
- Clicked **Connect** → Connection status changed to **Secure / Connected**.

### 4. Verify IP Change
- Before connecting → Checked IP at [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
- After connecting → IP changed to the VPN server’s region.  
 **Verified IP address masking.**

### 5. Browse and Confirm Encryption
- Opened websites such as **Wikipedia** and **Gmail**.  
- All traffic passed securely through encrypted channels (HTTPS + VPN tunnel).

### 6. Disconnect and Compare
- Disconnected from VPN → IP reverted to ISP’s address.  
- Browsing became slightly faster (no encryption overhead).  



## Summary: VPN Benefits and Limitations
### Benefits
- **Data Encryption:** All transmitted data is encrypted, protecting it from hackers and eavesdroppers.  
- **IP Masking:** Hides your real IP address and replaces it with the VPN server’s IP.  
- **Anonymity:** Prevents tracking by ISPs, advertisers, or malicious actors.  
- **Public Wi-Fi Safety:** Secures your connection on open networks (e.g., cafés, airports).  
- **Geo-Restriction Bypass:** Allows access to region-blocked websites and services.  
- **Privacy Protection:** Prevents ISPs from logging browsing history.  

### Limitations
- **Speed Reduction:** Encryption and routing can slightly reduce browsing and download speeds.  
- **Free VPN Risks:** May include data limits, ads, or sell user data.  
- **Connection Drops:** If VPN disconnects unexpectedly, your IP may be exposed.  
- **Compatibility Issues:** Some websites or streaming platforms block VPN traffic.  
- **Not Complete Security:** VPNs do not replace antivirus software or safe browsing habits.

## InterviewAnswers

**1. What is a VPN?**   
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet.  

**2. How does a VPN protect privacy?**  
It hides your IP address and encrypts your online traffic, preventing tracking or monitoring.  

**3. Difference between VPN and proxy?**  
A VPN encrypts all network traffic, while a proxy only hides your IP for specific apps or browsers.  

**4. What is encryption in VPN?**  
Encryption converts your data into unreadable code to protect it from unauthorized access.  

**5. Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?**  
No, VPNs enhance privacy but cannot provide complete anonymity online.  

**6. What protocols do VPNs use?**  
Common protocols include OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IKEv2/IPSec.  

**7. What are some VPN limitations?**  
VPNs may reduce speed, have limited free plans, and can’t block all online threats.  

**8. How does a VPN affect network speed?**  
VPNs slightly slow down speed due to encryption and rerouting of traffic through remote servers.
