## Interview Answers

Q1: What is vulnerability scanning?  
A: It is the process of automatically scanning systems to find security weaknesses and missing patches.

Q2: Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?  
A: Scanning finds vulnerabilities automatically, while penetration testing tries to exploit them manually to assess real risk.

Q3: What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?  
A: Outdated software, weak passwords, open ports, missing patches, and disabled firewalls/antivirus.

Q4: How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?  
A: They compare system information with known vulnerability databases (like CVE) and check for outdated or misconfigured services.

Q5: What is CVSS?  
A: The Common Vulnerability Scoring System, a standard scale (0–10) used to rate the severity of vulnerabilities.

Q6: How often should vulnerability scans be performed?  
A: Regularly—weekly or monthly—and after major updates or system changes.

Q7: What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?  
A: When a scanner reports a vulnerability that doesn’t actually exist on the target system.

Q8: How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?  
A: Based on CVSS score, severity level (Critical/High/Medium), exploitability, and business impact.
